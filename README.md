# StreamApp Backend

Welcome to the **StreamApp** backend! ðŸŽ‰ This repo holds the magic behind the scenes for real-time video streaming, user management, and all the awesome features we've cooked up. Built with the powerful combo of **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**, it's a solid foundation for streaming experiences.

This is a project we've both dived into headfirst, hustling and learning along the way. It's been an adventure, and we're excited to keep building it out. ðŸ™Œ

## Installation

Letâ€™s get this thing running on your machine!

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StreamApp-backend.git
   cd StreamApp-backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (aka the boring part):
   Make sure youâ€™ve got [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) up and running. Then:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables** (aka secret sauce time):
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and toss in the following:
   ```plaintext
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
   STREAM_API_KEY=your_streaming_api_key
   STREAM_API_SECRET=your_streaming_api_secret
   ```

4. **Start the dev server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Boom! ðŸŽ‰ The backend will be live on `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

### Running Locally
Now that the server is up, feel free to test out the API using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or connect your frontend.

### Running in Production
When you're ready to show the world, switch over to production mode with:
```bash
npm start
```
Donâ€™t forget to update those env variables to match your prod environment!

## Features

- **User Authentication**: JWT-based login/registration to keep things secure and smooth.
- **Real-Time Chat**: Talk to your viewers in real-time (coming soon, maybe).
- **User Profiles**: Upload avatars, update your detailsâ€”flex your profile! ðŸ˜Ž
- **Video Metadata**: Manage all the cool info about your streams like titles and descriptions.

## API Endpoints

Here's the rundown of our core endpoints:

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register new users
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login (token-based authentication)

### User
- `GET /api/users` - Fetch all users
- `GET /api/users/:id` - Fetch a user by ID
- `PUT /api/users/:id` - Update a userâ€™s profile

### Stream
- `POST /api/streams` - Create a stream
- `GET /api/streams` - Get all streams
- `GET /api/streams/:id` - Fetch stream by ID
- `PUT /api/streams/:id` - Update stream info
- `DELETE /api/streams/:id` - Delete a stream

### Chat (if applicable)
- `POST /api/chat` - Send messages during a stream
- `GET /api/chat/:streamId` - Fetch chat messages for a specific stream

## Technologies

Hereâ€™s the tech stack we used to bring this to life:

- **Backend Framework**: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) + [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- **Database**: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) to handle user and stream data
- **Authentication**: JWT for secure token-based authentication
- **Cloud Storage**: Integrated with Cloudinary for file uploads like avatars and cover images
- **File Uploads**: [Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) to handle the uploads
- **Security**: [Bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) to hash passwords (because we donâ€™t play when it comes to security) ðŸ”’
